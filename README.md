# CNN_XRay_classification
 This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: COVID, Normal, and Pneumonia. The goal is to develop a model that can assist in the automatic detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images, providing a valuable tool in medical diagnostics.
